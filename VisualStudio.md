## Keyboard shortcuts
*The ones I found helpful for now:*

Ctrl + P - recently opened files (newFile.js:46 (to go to the line 46 in this file); newFile.js@ (to see comments, variables, functions, etc. in this file and choose one)

Ctrl + shift + P - command palette (find a command, setting, action, etc. by simply typing its name)

Ctrl + K Ctrl + S - shows a full list of shortcuts ([download a full list in a PDF file](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf))

Ctrl + N - add a new file (will be 'Untitled' press Ctrl + S to save it with the title you wish and choose a folder for it)

Ctrl + S - save (or go to File -> Autosave to save ANY change you make)

I think it's easier to use buttons in Explorer near an opened folder name ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64921934/200819098-f508b5f2-d3a5-4802-bb09-92f78cc80f7e.png)

Ctrl + Tab - open next (switch between opened files)

Ctrl + ` - open a Terminal tab

Ctrl + H (to rename multiple variables)

shift + Alt + F - automatically format your code

Ctrl + right mouse click - multi cursor (press Esc to exit)

shift + Ctrl + L - add cursor to all the occurencies

F5 - to execute the code

## Settings
Format on Paste - turn On
Format on Save - turn On

### Python
To have a Python support you need to install an extention (Python (IntelliSense(Pylance))

### HTML
To have a webpage preview for HTML you need an extention (Live Preview (**by Microsoft**))
