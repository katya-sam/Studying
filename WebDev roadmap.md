# Web Developer roadmap

That will be my roapmap after watching quite a lot of YouTube videos.

1. learn how GitHub(or Git) works.
  I'll need it for my portfolio & this is a great way to track my studying progress.
2. learn how Dev tools work (in my case Visual studio/Webstorm)
3. main terminal/command line commands
4. HTML & CSS
5. Javascript
6. Framework/library (React, View, Angular) - I'll study React as it seems the most used one now.


Optional for now:
  unit test (Jest, Jasmine, RTL)
  e2e tests (Cypress, Selenium)
  styling libraries & CSS pre-processors (at least one of these: SASS, STYLED COMPONENTS, MATERIAL-UI, TAILWIND)
  only for SSR Apps no need in the beginning: SSR Frameworks (Next.js, Gatsby, Remix)
