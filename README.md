# Studying
Hi there!
I'm a MD and currently a SAHM to the cutest boy ever! (I know, every mom says that :D)

I've heard often that I'm "an experienced computer user", and I really enjoyed playing with registry, finding cheat codes for The Sims in my teens years and later changing CSS of my Anki cards, playing while True learn(). So when I got pregnant and had a bit of free time, I decided to try learning Python just for fun... and I really had fun :) That's why I decided to give it a try and learn to be a Developer.

I don't have a lot of free time (only 1.5h when my baby sleeps in the afternoon and around 2h in the evening), and I find all the info myself, I've never done a bootcamp or any course.

I decided to share my journey. Mostly to be able to laugh at myself later :D but also hoping someone will find it helpful at some point.

Thank you for reading! And good luck!


# Web Developer roadmap
That will be my roapmap after watching quite a lot of YouTube videos.

- [x] [learn how GitHub](https://github.com/katya-sam/Studying/blob/e5a3d9dc67c561339ac8e8648bdcfdcb4def5a3f/GitHub_basics.md)/Git works. I'll need it for my portfolio & this is a great way to track my studying progress.
- [ ] learn how Dev tools work (in my case Visual studio/Webstorm)
- [ ] main terminal/command line commands
- [x] [HTML & CSS](https://freecodecamp.org)
- [x] [Javascript](https://freecodecamp.org)
- [ ] Framework/library (React, View, Angular) - I'll study React as it seems the most used one now.

Optional for now: 
- unit test (Jest, Jasmine, RTL) 
- e2e tests (Cypress, Selenium) 
- styling libraries & CSS pre-processors (at least one of these: SASS, STYLED COMPONENTS, MATERIAL-UI, TAILWIND) 
- only for SSR Apps no need in the beginning: SSR Frameworks (Next.js, Gatsby, Remix)
