# Studying
Hi there!
I'm a MD and currently a SAHM to the cutest boy ever! (I know, every mom says that :D)

I've heard often that I'm "an experienced computer user", and really enjoyed myself playing with registry, finding cheat codes for The Sims in my teens years and later changing CSS of my Anki cards, playing while True learn(). So when I got pregnant and had a bit of free time, I decided to try learning Python just for fun... and I really had fun :) That's why I decided to give it a try and learn to be a Developer.

I don't have a lot of free time (only 1.5h when my baby sleeps in the afternoon and around 2h in the evening), and I find all the info myself, I've never done a bootcamp or any course.

I decided to share my journey. Mostly to be able to laugh at myself later :D but also hoping someone will find it helpful at some point.

Thank you for reading! And good luck!
